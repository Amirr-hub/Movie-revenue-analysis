# 🎬 Movie Revenue Analysis (Excel)

This project explores movie industry trends from 1980 to 2020 using Excel. The goal was to uncover meaningful patterns in financial performance across genres, ratings, and scores, and identify which types of films tend to deliver the highest return on investment.

## 📌 Overview
Using Excel, I sourced, cleaned, and analyzed movie data to investigate relationships between gross-to-budget ratios and key film attributes such as genre, MPAA rating, and critical scores. I built visualizations to support my findings and identify actionable trends that can inform production, investment, and marketing strategies within the media and entertainment industry.
